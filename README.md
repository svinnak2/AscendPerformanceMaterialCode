**High Level Objectives:** The objective of the project is 1) **Objective - 1:** to create a sales leads directory by scraping data from the web based on clients requirements 2) **Objective - 2:** to provide a Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG) based conversational AI solution.

**Solution:** To achieve these objectives, I implemented the following end-to-end architecture in AWS cloud.
